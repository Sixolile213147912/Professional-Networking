**Situation**: All 3rd year CPUT IT students were tasked with completing the Proefssional Networking course, as part of the Project Presentation 3 module.

**Task**: My goal was to go through the course content and complete the related assesments by or before the due date.

**Action**: I took the time to go through the course content, and completed the related assesments in time.

**Result**: I learnt that it takes time and constant work to establish genuine connections. It's an ongoing process rather than a one-time occurrence and requires establishing connections with peers, mentors, and coworkers, among others.
